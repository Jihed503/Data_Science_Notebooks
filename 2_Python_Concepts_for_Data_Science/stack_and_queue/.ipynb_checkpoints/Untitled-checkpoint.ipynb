    "## Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Push: which adds an element to the collection\n",
    "* Pop: which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a data structure based on the LIFO \"Last In, First Out\" principle, which means that the last elements added to the stack will be the first to be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stack \"Stack representation similar to a pile of plate\"](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/stack-of-plates_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can:\n",
    "* Put a new plate on top\n",
    "* Remove the top plate\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if you want the plate at the bottom, you must first remove all the plates on top. This is exactly how the stack data structure works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called pop.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above image, although item 2 was kept last, it was removed first. This is exactly how the LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement a stack in any programming language like Python.\n",
    "There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.\n",
    "* **Push:** Add an element to the top of a stack\n",
    "* **Pop:** Remove an element from the top of a stack\n",
    "* **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty\n",
    "* **IsFull:** Check if the stack is full\n",
    "* **Peek:** Get the value of the top element without removing it"

    "In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.\n",
